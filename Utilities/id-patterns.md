# @id Patterns (Recommended)

Use stable, URL-based IDs to link entities across schema blocks.

Examples:
- Organization: https://example.com/#organization
- LocalBusiness: https://example.com/#localbusiness
- Person: https://example.com/#person
- Service: https://example.com/services/service-name/#service
- WebSite: https://example.com/#website
- WebPage: https://example.com/page-slug/#webpage

Principles:
- Keep IDs stable over time
- Prefer one canonical entity per type
- Reference canonical entities via `@id` rather than duplicating data
